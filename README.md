## Warning 

Since Flutter Web is not supported in stable branch, this project requires dev, beta, or master branch version of Flutter. 
You can change it by typing
```bash
flutter channel dev         # alternatively can be master or beta
flutter upgrade             # download chosen version of Flutter
flutter config --enable-web # enable Flutter Web support
```
